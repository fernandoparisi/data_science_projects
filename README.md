# Data Science Projects - Phyton

Projects developed in Python, carried out as part of the Advanced Diploma in Applied Data Science at the UTN. Various libraries were used, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, keras, among others.

#1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted an exploratory data analysis on Airbnb accommodation prices across various neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. Focused on identifying patterns, trends, and outliers to provide insights into pricing dynamics.

#2. Supervised Learning: Performed data analysis using supervised learning classification techniques, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Evaluated model performance through accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

#3. Unsupervised Learning: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to enhance model performance. Compared the results of a Logistic Regression model (supervised learning) using both the full feature set and the reduced features after performing EDA.

#4. Neural Networks: Built and trained a neural network for binary classification using Keras. Developed models with dense layers, optimized with Adam and RMSprop, and assessed performance using accuracy, AUC, and loss metrics.

#5. Deep Learning for Computer Vision: Implemented a deep learning model for classifying images of cats and dogs using computer vision techniques. Utilized ImageDataGenerator for image augmentation and employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 for accurate binary classification.
